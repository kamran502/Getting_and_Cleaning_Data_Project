# Introduction

Script "run_analysis.R" accomplishes all 5 tasks required in Coursera assignment.

1. Merges "train" and "test" data using the "rbind" function.
2. Columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are filtered from the dataset as required then they are given the names mentioned in "features.txt".
3. Uses descriptive activity names from "activity_labels.txt" to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output file is generated as "averages_data.txt" and uploaded to repository.

# Variables

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in `mean_and_std_features`, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the `activities` variable.
* `all_data` merges `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` in a big dataset.
* Finally, `averages_data` contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a `.txt` file. `ddply()` from the plyr package is used to apply `colMeans()` and ease the development.
